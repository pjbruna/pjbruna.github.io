During my undergraduate at Vassar College, I worked under [Dr. Jan Andrews](https://www.vassar.edu/faculty/andrewsj) and [Dr. Josh de Leeuw](https://www.vassar.edu/faculty/jdeleeuw) studying learned categorical perception (LCP). LCP is a proposed top-down effect referring to the influence of category learning on oneâ€™s ability to discriminate certain perceptual features when these features are category-defining. Reports of LCP effects in the literature are sparse and methodologically dissonant, a situation which is not aided by the publication bias against negative results present in the behavioral sciences. Hence, the aim of this research program is to systematically investigate the impact of various methodological choices in LCP research in order to determine how robust LCP effects are. My time on this project included developing new methods for stimulus development leveraging generative adversarial neural networks to create latent perceptual dimensional spaces, producing an innovative adaptive staircasing procedure for crowd-sourced, online psychophysical data collection, and proposing a new method for statistically defining and testing for LCP effects.

Additionally, I completed an independent research project in semantic network modeling where I investigated if differences in human judgments of semantic relatedness across different types of semantic relations (e.g. linguistic versus thematic) were reflected in the distributed, structural properties of semantic networks (in particular, how the interaction between various, differentially-weighted paths through a semantic network produces judgments of semantic relatedness between word pairs by fitting a spreading activation model to behavioral data). I also completed a graduation thesis evaluating the capacity for a simple recurrent neural network to produce meaningul linguistic segmentation in Japanese, which exhibits a morphologically complex agglutinative structure that traditional language models are ill-equipped to handle.

My BA in Philosophy included focuses in **metaphilosophy**, **epistemology**, and **East and Southeast Asian philosophy** (especially Chinese philosophy). I consider studying under [Dr. Bryan Van Norden](http://www.bryanvannorden.com), [Dr. Sofia Ortiz-Hinojosa](https://www.vassar.edu/faculty/sortizhinojosa), and [Dr. Douglas Winblad](https://www.vassar.edu/faculty/emeriti/dowinblad) to be especially formative to my philosophical training.

I currently work with [Dr. Michael Spivey](https://michaelspivey.academia.edu), [Dr. Rachel Ryskin](https://raryskin.github.io), and [Dr. Chris Kello](http://cogmech.ucmerced.edu) at UC Merced developing computational models to study such topics as cognitive alignment and language.
