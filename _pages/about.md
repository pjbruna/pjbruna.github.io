I am a PhD student in the department of [Cognitive and Information Sciences](https://cogsci.ucmerced.edu/) at UC Merced and an [Adolph Sutro Fellow](https://offices.vassar.edu/fellowships/fellowships/graduates/vassar/list-of-vassar-fellowships/) at Vassar College. I graduated *Phi Beta Kappa*, *Sigma Xi*, and *Psi Chi* from Vassar College in [Cognitive Science](https://www.vassar.edu/cogsci/) and [Philosophy](https://www.vassar.edu/philosophy) (*cum laude generali et cum laude in materia subiecta*).
