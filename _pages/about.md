I am a PhD student in the department of [Cognitive and Information Sciences](https://cogsci.ucmerced.edu/) at UC Merced and an [Adolph Sutro Fellow](https://offices.vassar.edu/fellowships/fellowships/graduates/vassar/list-of-vassar-fellowships/) at Vassar College. I graduated *Phi Beta Kappa*, *Sigma Xi*, and *Psi Chi* from Vassar College in [Cognitive Science](https://www.vassar.edu/cogsci/) and [Philosophy](https://www.vassar.edu/philosophy) (*cum laude generali et cum laude in materia subiecta*).


*"'So who made the machines? That's who we want to contact.'

'They made the machines. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Meat made the machines.'

'That's ridiculous. How can meat make a machine? You're asking me to believe in sentient meat.'"* - [They're Made out of Meat (Bisson, 1991)](https://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/thinkingMeat.html)
