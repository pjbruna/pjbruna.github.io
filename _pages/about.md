## Current Research
I currently work with [Dr. Michael Spivey](https://michaelspivey.academia.edu), [Dr. Rachel Ryskin](https://raryskin.github.io), and [Dr. Chris Kello](http://cogmech.ucmerced.edu) at UC Merced evolving cognitive alignment in an unsupervised reservoir computing network model across multiple scales of complexity. This approach fundamentally situates language as a complex (and developmental) system and is largely inspired by applying lessons from dynamical systems theory and complexity science to questions of how agents represent, navigate, and communicate about a shared world.
<!--I currently work with [Dr. Michael Spivey](https://michaelspivey.academia.edu), [Dr. Rachel Ryskin](https://raryskin.github.io), and [Dr. Chris Kello](http://cogmech.ucmerced.edu) at UC Merced evolving semantic and syntactic interdependence in a reservoir computing model that I hope to scale-up to produce linguistic change in dyadic and population-level dynamics. This approach fundamentally situates language as a complex and noisy perceptual feature that cognitive agents enact in the world. By viewing language as a complex (and developmental) system, I adopt a holistic perspective in which meaning emerges from temporal contingencies amongst distributed representations which embed hierarchical linguistic structure in linear input. This perspective is largely inspired by applying lessons from dynamical systems theory and developmental biology to questions of how agents represent, navigate, and communicate about a shared world.-->

With this research:

  1) I wish to develop computational tools for advancing machine translation technologies for morphologically and syntactically distant language pairs (by aligning internal state spaces of a cognitive agent directly rather than matching inputs and outputs across languages with diverse orthographies, morphologies, etc.), which are vital in a world which is becoming increasingly globalized and technologized.
  
  2) I wish to develop artificially intelligent systems that are capable of forming converstional dyads and achieving cognitive alignment with human actors. Intelligent machines are becoming increasingly integrated into human activities, both professional and personal, and are being given radically collaborative roles in industries such as architecture, product design, and engineering. These spaces in which humans and machines are engaging in collaborative creativity generate a demand for intelligent machines that are robust in varied and novel communicative tasks by developing effective and adaptive communication strategies with human collaborators.

## Background
During the completion of my BA in Cognitive Science at Vassar College, I worked under [Dr. Jan Andrews](https://www.vassar.edu/faculty/andrewsj) and [Dr. Josh de Leeuw](https://www.vassar.edu/faculty/jdeleeuw) studying learned categorical perception (LCP). LCP is a proposed top-down effect referring to the influence of category learning on oneâ€™s ability to discriminate certain perceptual features when these features are category-defining. Reports of LCP effects in the literature are sparse and methodologically dissonant, a situation which is not aided by the publication bias against negative results present in the behavioral sciences. Hence, the aim of this research program is to systematically investigate the impact of various methodological choices in LCP research in order to determine how robust LCP effects are. My time on this project included developing new methods for stimulus development leveraging generative adversarial neural networks to create latent perceptual dimensional spaces, producing an innovative adaptive staircasing procedure for crowd-sourced, online psychophysical data collection, and proposing a new method for statistically defining and testing for LCP effects.

Additionally, I completed an independent research project in semantic network modeling where I investigated if differences in human judgments of semantic relatedness across different types of semantic relations (e.g. linguistic versus thematic) were reflected in the distributed, structural properties of semantic networks<!-- (in particular, how the interaction between various, differentially-weighted paths through a semantic network produces judgments of semantic relatedness between word pairs by fitting a spreading activation model to behavioral data)-->. I also completed a graduation thesis evaluating the capacity for a simple recurrent neural network to produce meaningful linguistic segmentation in Japanese, which exhibits a morphologically complex agglutinative structure that traditional language models are ill-equipped to handle.

My BA in Philosophy included focuses in **metaphilosophy**, **epistemology**, and **East Asian and Indian philosophy** (especially Chinese philosophy). I consider studying under [Dr. Bryan Van Norden](http://www.bryanvannorden.com), [Dr. Sofia Ortiz-Hinojosa](https://www.vassar.edu/faculty/sortizhinojosa), and [Dr. Douglas Winblad](https://www.vassar.edu/faculty/emeriti/dowinblad) to be especially formative to my philosophical training.
