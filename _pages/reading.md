Below I highlight a handful of key writers and texts which have inspired my thinking throughout the years. I occasionally update these listings to reflect what is currently on my mind; therefore, an archive of titles that have appeared on this page may be found at the bottom.

## Current Highlights

**- *Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature* (Richard Rorty)**
**- *Against Method* (Paul Feyerabend)**
**- *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions* (Thomas S. Kuhn)**
