**Semantics and Syntax Co-emerge in Adaptive Reservoir Network Dynamics**

**Bruna, P.** & Spivey, M. J. *(Manuscript in preparation)*

It is well known that a word can carry different meanings in different contexts, but how exactly do lexical semantics interact with a broader syntactic context? On the one hand, meaning at the lexical level may influence how one syntactically parses the sentence within which it is embedded. Snedeker & Trueswell (2004) found behavioral evidence that the interpretation of syntactically ambiguous verb-argument structures is influenced by a verb’s bias towards one of these structures or another, and more recent evidence from Ryskin et al. (2017) indicates that these verb biases can be manipulated through experience. This constitutes behavioral evidence that semantics can influence syntax in language use. On the other hand, in neural network simulations, changes in lexico-syntactic context have been shown to subtly modulate the population encoding of lexical inputs, or, in other words, induce shifts in semantics. (Elman, 2009). These findings suggest that the distinction between semantics and syntax may be more conceptual than it is indicative of two natural kinds. Building on the findings of Falandays et al. (2021), we test if an unsupervised, adaptive reservoir computing network is able to learn long-distance dependencies in a simple linguistic environment of sentences containing verbs which have differential biases toward possible arguments. The future goal of this work is to use this model to explore if changes in the statistical patterns of verb bias result in semantic shifts. This work uses computational modeling to explore how semantics and syntax can co-emerge as linguistic properties from simple adaptive behaviors of a cognitive agent entraining with its environment.

**What Next? : Leveraging Surprise in a Recurrent Neural Network to (de)Construct Morphological Complexity in Japanese**

**Bruna, P.** *(This work was completed as an undergraduate senior thesis; 2022)*

The question of how we as cognitive agents and biological creatures acting within a world describe, understand, and communicate about this shared world and our motivations within it has long existed at the center of cognitive science. The ability to utilize language has even been hailed as a hallmark of what it is to have a mind. Language is an action that involves transforming complex, non-linear information about the world and ourselves into linear expressions and communicating them in real time, and yet it seems every language accomplishes this in its own way. Formal language modeling exhibits a bias towards the linguistic features observed in English and related languages, namely the ability to describe language in terms of word-based units. This bias has caused language models to be ill-equipped for success in languages exhibiting a high degree of morphological complexity, such as the agglutinative morphology found in Japanese, and indicates a shortcoming in our understanding of the underlying cognitive processes that allow us to be thinkers, speakers, and listeners. This study embarks on an effort to challenge the traditional scales at which we conceptualize information processing in language. I employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) to explore character-by-character predictability in samples of contemporary Japanese text. I address what properties of agglutinative morphology are salient to neural networks and offer a comparison between meaning construction in Japanese and English. This study further investigates the unique morpho-syntactic role played by orthography in Japanese. I find success in extracting certain key features of the structure of Japanese sentences using an RNN and offer a path for deepening our understanding of the differences in information encoding and processing that we observe across languages and how these differences arise.

**Probing the Methodology and Interpretation of Learned Categorical Perception Research**

*Manuscript in preparation*

Learned categorical perception (CP) is a phenomenon where learning to place objects in categories influences how similar they appear, with objects in different categories becoming easier to tell apart and/or objects in the same category becoming harder to tell apart. Despite these effects being widely demonstrated, past studies exhibit low statistical power and the literature lacks a unifying theoretical framework. We seek to rectify these issues by conducting a systematic methodological investigation of learned CP, starting with replicating the effect under the conditions with which it has traditionally been reported, then exploring how successive methodological changes impact the presence of the effect. Our replication failed to show a pattern indicative of learned CP from comparing discrimination performance between a group that had learned a category distinction and a control group that had not. Through exploring our data to scrutinize possible key differences between our study and previous demonstrations of learned CP, we hypothesized that a combination of our stimuli being too easy to discriminate and the memorization of individual stimuli along each dimension obstructed the influence of category membership on discrimination behavior and was responsible for the absence of CP effects. We addressed this issue by lowering the discriminability of stimulus pairs and by increasing the number of stimuli in each category. Preliminary results suggest a possible learned CP effect and we plan to collect additional data to clarify the nature of the pattern.

**Psychophysical Adaptive Procedure: Developing a New, Generalizable Method**

**Bruna, P.** *(This work was completed as an undergraduate research project; 2021)*

“Staircasing” is a classic experimental procedure used in psychophysics wherein when a subject successfully discriminates between two stimuli that differ on one perceptual dimension, the stimuli become more similar to each other on that dimension, and when the subject fails, the stimuli become more different. The purpose of this procedure is to find the size of the difference that produces a specific level of discrimination success. Traditional staircase procedures require subjects to be run individually for many trials. Our goal was to develop a procedure for crowd-sourced online data collection in which subjects can be tested simultaneously using only a few trials each with every new piece of data altering the stimulus pair shown on the next trial. We do this by continually fitting subject responses to a plausible function that is used to predict the difference that should produce the desired accuracy level. Only presenting differences predicted to yield the desired performance allows us to find the difference corresponding to this accuracy level faster than sampling the whole range of stimulus differences. The stimulus values we determined with this method were used for research on the phenomenon of learned categorical perception. We present this new technique as an efficient way of determining psychophysical values more generally for purposes of controlling stimulus discriminability in experimental research.

**Exploring Semantic Relatedness Judgments in the Structure of a Semantic Network**

**Bruna, P.** *(This work was completed as an undergraduate independent study project; 2020)*

Drawing upon work by De Deyne et al. (2016), I explore a model of spreading activation through a semantic network in regards to how different kinds of semantic relationships are encoded  in  said  network.  In  particular,  I  examine  the contribution  of  indirect  pathways  through  the  network  to explain differences in similarity judgments of sensorimotor and linguistic relationships between pairs of words. I propose that the structure of a semantic network  encodes properties that distinguish these two types of semantic relationships that are not  revealed  by  measures  of  association  strength  that  only examine  direct  connections  within  the  network.  A  cosine similarity measure extracted from a spreading activation model is compared to a measure of association strength in accounting for observed similarity judgments, and a model for examining the differential contributions of various random walk pathways through a semantic network in the encoding of sensorimotor and linguistic semantic relationships is presented.
