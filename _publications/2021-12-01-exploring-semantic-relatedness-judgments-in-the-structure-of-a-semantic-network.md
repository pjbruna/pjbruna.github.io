excerpt: 'Drawing upon work by De Deyne et al. (2016), I explore a model of spreading activation through a semantic network in regards to how different kinds of semantic relationships are encoded  in  said  network.  In  particular,  I  examine  the contribution  of  indirect  pathways  through  the  network  to explain differences in similarity judgments of sensorimotor and linguistic relationships between pairs of words. I propose that the structure of a semantic network  encodes properties that distinguish these two types of semantic relationships that are not  revealed  by  measures  of  association  strength  that  only examine  direct  connections  within  the  network.  A  cosine similarity measure extracted from a spreading activation model is compared to a measure of association strength in accounting for observed similarity judgments, and a model for examining the differential contributions of various random walk pathways through a semantic network in the encoding of sensorimotor and linguistic semantic relationships is presented.'
